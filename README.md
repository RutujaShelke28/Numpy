# Numpy

This repository contains my collection of basic NumPy function implementations and practice scripts. It covers essential operations like array creation, indexing, slicing, reshaping, mathematical computations, and basic data manipulation using NumPy — one of Python’s most powerful libraries for numerical computing. The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of NumPy fundamentals and provide a simple reference for anyone starting with data analysis or machine learning in Python.
